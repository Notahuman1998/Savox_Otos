1. Currently, Otos needs to have a NFC device to read hearing profile then writes the data into writer then NFC cards. we need to create MOBILE APP instead so 
if user lost their cards they can still use another cards or even mobile phone to touch on the NFC reader.
2. NFC funcionality works fine now, need to test NFC FROM PHONE'S APP TO CARDS.
3. Device can output the audio but the ALGORITHMS still NOT WORK yet due to NON-UNDERSTANDING ABOUT ALGORIRTHMS such as what I need to do, what factors we need 
to improve, what our solutions are, how?
